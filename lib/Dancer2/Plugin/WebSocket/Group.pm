package Dancer2::Plugin::WebSocket::Group;
# ABSTACT: Grouping of connections to send messages to

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    websocket_on_message sub {
        my( $conn, $message ) = @_;

        if ( $message eq 'tell to everybody' ) {
            $conn->to( '* ' )->send( "HEY, Y'ALL!" );
        }
    };

=head1 DESC

Those objects are generated via the C<to> method of the L<Dancer2::Plugin::WebSocket::Connection>
objects, and allow to easily send to groups of connections.

In addition to any channels one might fancy creating, each connection also has a private
channel that is associated to its numerical id, and a global channel C<*> also exist
to send messages to all connections.
